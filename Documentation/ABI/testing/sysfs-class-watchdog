What:		/sys/class/watchdog/watchdogn/nowayout

Contact:	Wim Van Sebroeck <wim@iguana.be>
Description:
		It is a read/write file. While reading, it gives '1'
		if the device has the nowayout feature set, otherwise
		it gives '0'. Writing a '1' to the file enables the
		nowayout feature. Once set, the nowayout feature
		cannot be disabled, so writing a '0' either has no
		effect (if the feature was already disabled) or
		results in a permission error.
